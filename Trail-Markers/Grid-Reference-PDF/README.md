Trail Markers listing in PDF, a quasi-broken database (not useful for hikers)

`Perplexing` 

The label "Distance Post" on the sign post is misleading. It has nothing to do with distance. However, since the markers are roughly 500 m apart, one can argue strenuously that these are approximately incremental distance counters. More accurately, they should be titled "Truncated MGRS Coordinate with an ambigious grid zone GZD". Most hikers don't know, don't need or don't care about MGRS Coordinates anyway.

`Curiosity - What's MGRS` 

If you are familiar with MGRS or wearing a Garmin watch with MGRS display, when you come across a Hong Kong trail marker, you will notice that the Grid Reference on the sign post is basically a truncated MGRS (100 m resolution) BUT the grid zone designator `GZD` is omitted.
That omission would be okay if all the activities are within the same GZD, unfortunately they are not (see below Lantau and MacLehose), hence the following issues arise:

`Issues`

Wilson Trail: all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q (cool, no issues)<br>
Hong Kong Trail: all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q (cool, no issues)<br>
BUT <br>
Lantau Trail: trail markers L001 to L133 are in grid zone 49Q, trail markers L134 to L139 are in grid zone 50Q (not cool)<br>
MacLehose Trail: trail markers M001 to M190 are in grid zone 50Q, trail markers M191 to M200 are in grid zone 49Q (not cool)<br>

`Design flaw` 

Grid reference with ambigious grid zone is an inferior approach (case in point, see Lantau Trail and MacLehose Trail above).
