Trail Markers listing in PDF, a quasi-broken database (not useful for hikers)

`Perplexing` The label "Distance Post" on the sign post is misleading. It has nothing to do with distance. However, since the markers are roughly 500 m apart, one can argue strenuously that these are indeed incremental distance counters. More accurately, they should be titled "Truncated MGRS Coordinate with an ambigious grid zone GZD". Most hikers don't know, don't need or don't care about MGRS Coordinates anyway.

`Curiosity` If you are familiar with MGRS or wearing a Garmin watch with MGRS, when you come across a trail marker, you will notice that the Grid Reference on the sign post is basically a truncated MGRS (100 m resolution) and the grid zone designator `GZD` is omitted.
That omission would be okay if all the (hiking) activities are within the same GZD, unfortunately they are not, hence the following issues/complexity arise:

`Complexity`<br>
Wilson Trail: all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q (cool)<br>
Hong Kong Trail: all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q (cool)<br>
Lantau Trail: trail markers L001 to L133 are in grid zone 49Q, markers L134 to L139 are in grid zone 50Q (totally not cool)<br>
MacLehose Trail: trail markers M001 to M190 are in grid zone 50Q, markers M191 to M200 are in grid zone 49Q (totally not cool)<br>

`Design flaw` Grid reference with ambigious grid zone is an inferior approach (i.e., Lantau Trail and MacLehose Trail).
