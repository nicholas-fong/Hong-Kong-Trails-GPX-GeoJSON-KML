Trail Markers (somewhat useful or not useful for hikers, depends on personal preference)

Import these markers (waypoints) to layer on top of hiking trails. Or simply use the markers as guide without the underlying route tracks.

`Marker Nomenclature`

The first letter of the marker (sign post) denotes the first letter of the trail name.
<br>M denotes MacLehose Trail, H denotes Hong Kong Trail, L denotes Lantau Trail, W dentoes Wilson Trail

`Stats` 

There is a total of 567 trail markers for the 4 major hiking trails. On average, there is a trail marker (sign post) roughly every 500 meters. Hong Kong Trail has 100 markers, Lantau Trail has 139 markers, MacLehose Trail has 200 markers and Wilson Trail has 137 markers. 

`Files` 

Geo coordinates for the trail markers (sign posts) are compiled and stroed as `GPX` and `KML`.

`Footnote`

1.8 km of Wilson Trail and Hong Kong Trail overlap each other near Jardine's Lookout. Hence 5 unusually labelled trail markers exist in that stretch: H053;W009 H054;W010 H055;W011 H056;W012 H057;W013
