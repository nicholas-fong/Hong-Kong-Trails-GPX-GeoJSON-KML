# Hong-Kong-Trails-GPX-Hiking
For hiking enthusiasts savvy with mobile devices and offline hiking apps. This repository hosts a complete set of unofficial high quality GPX tracks/routes for the 4 major hiking trails in Hong Kong SAR (MacLehose Trail 麥理浩徑 98 km, Hong Kong Trail 港島徑 45 km, Wilson Trail 衛奕信徑 76 km and Lantau Trail 鳳凰徑 67 km for a total of 286 km with over 24,000 route points). Use these files at your own risks.

Methodology used to generate these tracks:<br>
Using [Overpass](https://www.overpass-turbo.eu) query wizard to extract trails and export the result to [Java OpenStreetMap Editor](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) to manually correct data inconsistencies and other errors. The cleaned up data is then converted to `GPX tracks`,`GPX routes` and `KML` using codes from [geoJSON-gpx-convert](https://github.com/nicholas-fong/geoJSON-gpx-convert). The elevation of the trails is derived from NASA's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer `ASTER` Global Digital Elevation Model `GDEM` GeoTIFF geospatial metadata based on the GPS coordinates of the trails, using codes from [gpx-add-SRTM](https://github.com/nicholas-fong/gpx-add-SRTM)

To visualize: download a GeoJSON file and drop it in [geojson.io](https://geojson.io).`GPX track` and `GPX route` are both hosted in this repository because some devices/hiking apps work better with `GPX track` and others work better with `GPX route`. `KML` version of the trails are hosted in this repository for visualization with `Google Earth` or `Google My Maps` or import to MAPS.ME or similar mobile apps that can import KML. 
Mobile phone version of Google Maps, despite its popularity in vehicle navigatioin and "offline mode", IMHO it is not designed to be used with GPX/KML for hiking navigation (perhaps in the future). Examples of good offline hiking apps are `Locus Map` (Andorid) and `Komoot`, `MAPS.ME` (Andorid and iOS). If you use `Garmin` handheld GPS, simply import the GPX hiking trails to your handheld.

Due to the length and difficulties of the full trails, hiking trails are divided into sections/stages. Consult [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hiking_trails_in_Hong_Kong) or [Enjoy Hiking website](https://www.hiking.gov.hk) for trail heads and how to get there. Some segments of the trails have no transportation, no shelters, no food, no water and no mobile phone coverage.

`Government sites` The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department `AFCD` 漁農自然護理署 of Hong Kong SAR's [Enjoy Hiking website](https://www.hiking.gov.hk) is an excellent starting point for planning a hike. The Country and Marine Parks Authority `CMPA` 郊野公園及海岸公園管理局 of Hong Kong SAR operates and maintains the trails.
The Office of the Communications Authority `OFCA` 通訊事務管理局辦公室 of Hong Kong SAR publishes [PDF trail maps](https://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/consumer_focus/guide/safety/country_parks/coverage_survey/digital_map/index.html) with estimated mobile phone signal coverage. It is prudent to print a backup paper map especially for long hikes just in case GPS technology devices go badly during the hike. 

Carrying a fully charged battery power bank can prevent the situation of depleted phone battery.
